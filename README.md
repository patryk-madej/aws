## Finished my first functional personal project in AWS. 

What a strange time. One day everything is beyond your wildest dreams, next day world is in quarantine.

I made a serverless webscraper, which sends me an email each time a new event is published on a particular website. I needed it because the website is missing email subscription and their events were getting fully booked before I could react. Now I've got an edge over manually booking folks.

Very proud of this, given I knew nothing about any of the components merely few months ago. No code, nothing. Before, I was mostly image oriented (still can be, see the diagram!). 


## Technical details.

I've written two Lambda functions in Python with custom IAM roles and settings (timeouts mostly, one environmental variable). First Lambda is deployed from Cloud9, as it was the easiest way to include several 3rd party libraries it required - that's the webscraper itself using libraries such as BeautifulSoup, lxml and requests. Triggered by CloudWatch every 6hrs, the function searches the website against a pattern. Once scraped, the data is then published to DynamoDB table, which in turn triggers the second Lambda through Streams (DB updates tracker). Output is then sent to my email via SNS topic.

## Let me know what you think!

I'm very much a beginner, so please share any comments on how to improve it. At the moment probably the weakest part is the first Lambda, the webscraper. The pattern is hard-coded, so the smallest change in formatting on the website will break the app, as it already did once.

Also, looking for suggestions on how to move forward, maybe make something similar into a customer friendly product? But how?
